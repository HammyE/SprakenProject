this cussedness alienates middle of road voters as trust keeps eroding. people recall past &amp; see present noting #modi is doing what is also done for other faiths; they then rally against shaming of #hindus which sanghavi &amp; type eg. sreenivasan, kapri, sardesai do.  #bjp

vir sanghavi: parties other than #bjp followed non-religious  but now pander to #hindus. he forgets shah bano; #muslim-yadav axis, tv tracked iftaars &amp; ajmer visits, imams‚Äô election backing, resources for muslims etc. similar for sikh &amp; christian votes also. #hindutva
