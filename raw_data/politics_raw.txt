This cussedness alienates middle of road voters as trust keeps eroding. People recall past &amp; see present noting #Modi is doing what is also done for other faiths; they then rally against shaming of #Hindus which Sanghavi &amp; type eg. Sreenivasan, Kapri, Sardesai do. #Politics #BJP

Instead of #Identity #politics, reductionist politics seems more accurate a term since this element within politics, this phenomenon reduces everything to physical appearance. 2/2
#Identity #politics is politics. What you identify with is a good indicator of what you're for and against and as a result your voting pattern. The emphasis should be on why what is identified with now is largely reduced to or heavily focused on physical appearance? 1/2
